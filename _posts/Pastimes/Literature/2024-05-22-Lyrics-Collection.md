## Millie Turner

### The Shadow

```
[Verse 1]
She and her shadow walked side by side
Not talking as she brushed the fringe from her eyes
Too dark to see her
Or anything so they held hands

[Verse 2]
They walked until they both were lost
Asked for directions but could not stop
Each step synchronised
Two figures in disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know about you
And you don't know about me
But I can see right through
All the things that we could be
I don't know about you
And you don't know about me
But I can see right through
All the things that we could be

[Chorus]
You can take what you want from me
You can take almost everything
Cause the shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me
The shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me
You can take what you want from me
You can take almost everything
Cause the shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me
The shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me

[Bridge]
Feeling this he admired the girls face
As she started to smile and he started to fall for her
Tripping down the cliff into a dark deep daze
She didn't notice but blushed anyways

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know about you
And you don't know about me
But I can see right through
All the things that we could be
I don't know about you
And you don't know about me
But I can see right through
All the things that we could be

[Chorus]
You can take what you want from me
You can take almost everything
Cause the shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me
The shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me
You can take what you want from me
You can take almost everything
Cause the shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me
The shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me

[Hook]
She fell for the shadow
She fell for the shadow
She fell for the shadow
She fell for the shadow
She fell for the shadow
She fell for the shadow
She fell for the shadow
She fell for the shadow

[Outro]
They stood there together with nothing said
Balancing closely so close to the edge
And looked to their feet, suddenly a part of this life
And felt on top of the world
