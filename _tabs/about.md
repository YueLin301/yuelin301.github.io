Hi, this is Yue Lin (or æž—è¶Š, in Chinese), and welcome to my personal website.

Currently, I am a research assistant in School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, fortunately advised by Prof. Baoxiang Wang.
Here, I will regularly update my experiences, notes, and the computational magic spells of all the techniques that interest me.

> And how could I bear to be a man, if man were not also a creator and guesser of riddles and redeemer of accidents? To redeem those who lived in the past and to recreate all "it was" into "thus I willed it"â€”that alone should I call redemption.
