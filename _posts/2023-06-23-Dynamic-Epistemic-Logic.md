> Three logicians walk into a bar.  
The bartender asks: "Do you all want a drink?"  
The first logician says: "I don't know."  
The second logician says: "I don't know."  
The third logician says: "Yes."

## What is Dynamic Epistemic Logic?

> Dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) is a logical framework dealing with knowledge and information change. 
Typically, DEL focuses on situations involving multiple agents and studies how their knowledge changes when events occur.[^wiki-Dynamic-Epistemic-Logic]

There are two kinds of events:
- Ontic events: These events can change factual properties of the actual world, e.g., a red card is painted in blue. 
- Epistemic events: These events can change agent's knowledge without changing factual properties of the world, e.g., a card is revealed publicly (or privately) to be red.  

> In computer science, DEL is for example very much related to multi-agent systems, which are systems where multiple intelligent agents interact and exchange information.[^wiki-Dynamic-Epistemic-Logic]



I discovered that this topic shares some relevance with the theory of mind in certain aspects. Both of them concern the knowledge of agents and involve analyzing how the agents modeling others'.

## Common Knowledge

> The notion of common knowledge, where **everyone knows, everyone knows that everyone knows, etc.**, has proven to be fundamental in various disciplines, including Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence, Game Theory, Psychology, and Distributed Systems. This key notion was first studied by the philosopher **David Lewis** in the context of **conventions**. Lewis pointed out that in order for something to be a convention, it must in fact be common knowledge among the members of a group. (For example, the convention that green means “go” and red means “stop” is presumably common knowledge among the drivers in our society.)[^Common-knowledge-revisited]

> Common knowledge also arises in discourse understanding. Suppose Ann asks Bob “What did you think of the movie?” referring to a showing of Monkey Business they have just seen. Not only must Ann and Bob both know that “the movie” refers to Monkey Business, **but Ann must know that Bob knows (so that she can be sure that Bob will give a reasonable answer to her question), Bob must know that Ann knows that Bob knows (so that Bob knows that Ann will respond appropriately to his answer)**, and so on. In fact, by a closer analysis of this situation, it can be shown that there must be common knowledge of what movie is meant in order for Bob to answer the question appropriately.[^Common-knowledge-revisited]
