## Key Idea

- A* = BFS + priority queue
    - BFS: For each node, add all its child nodes to the search queue.
    - A*: There is an order for adding child nodes to the search queue.
- What is the order? By the estimated distance $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$.
    - $x$ is the current child node.
    - $h(x)$ is the distance between the current node and the end node.
        - The greedy algorithm: $f(x) = h(x)$
        - This distance is estimated. Obstacles are not concerned yet.
    - $g(x)$ is the distance between the current node and the start node.
        - $g(x) = g(p(x)) + 1$ where $p(x)$ is the parent node of $x$.

## Example

### f

### My Intuition

- It may be related to the ellipse.
    - $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$
    - Each end is a focus.
    - Find the smallest ellipse.
    - But: $h(x)$ is the standard one, while $g(x)$ is constructed by the BFS memory which is affected by obstacles.
