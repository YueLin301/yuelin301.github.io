Hi, this is Yue Lin (/ÀàjuÀêe…™ l…™n/, or ÊûóË∂ä in Chinese), and welcome to my personal website. 
Currently, I am a research assistant in School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, fortunately advised by Prof. Baoxiang Wang.
Here, I will regularly update my experiences, notes, and computational magic spells of all the techniques that interest me.
