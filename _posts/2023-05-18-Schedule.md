2. [Fictitious Play Basics](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Fictitious-Play-Basics/);
3. [Fictitious Play in MARL](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Fictitious-Play-MARL/);
4. [Information Design (A Note)](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Information-Design/): Almost finished;
5. [MARL Tasks](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/MARL-Tasks/);
6. [TCS Basics](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/TCS-Basics/);
7. [A Brief Explanation of Personality](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/personality/).

Depending on the circumstances, there may be additional blogs added to the queue along the way. 
The order of completion is not fixed.
If I come up with something and have spare time, I will add content to the corresponding blog at any time.
