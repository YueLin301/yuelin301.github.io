## Writing Schedule

Generally, I will finish my blogs in the following order: 
1. [Zero-Determinant Strategy]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/Zero-Determinant);
2. [Sequential Social Dilemma]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/SSD)
3. [Fictitious Play and Zero-Shot Coordination]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/Fictitious-Self-Play-Zero-Shot-Coordination/);
4. [Sequence-to-Sequence Models]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/Seq2Seq);
5. [Details on the Analysis of Policy Gradient Methods]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/Policy-Gradient-Details/);
6. [MARL Basics]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/MARL-Basics/);
7. [Information Design]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/Information-Design/): Almost finished;

Depending on the circumstances, there may be additional blogs added to the queue along the way. 
The order of completion is not fixed.
If I come up with something and have spare time, I will add content to the corresponding blog at any time.
