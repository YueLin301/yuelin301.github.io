Generally, I will finish my blogs in the following order: 
1. [Fictitious Play Basics](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Fictitious-Play-Basics/);
2. [Fictitious Play in MARL](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Fictitious-Play-MARL/)
3. [Information Design (A Note)](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Information-Design/): Almost finished;
4. [MARL Tasks](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/MARL-Tasks/);
5. [A Brief Explanation of Personality](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/personality/).

Depending on the circumstances, there may be additional blogs added to the queue along the way. 
The order of completion is not fixed.
If I come up with something and have spare time, I will add content to the corresponding blog at any time.
