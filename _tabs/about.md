Hi, this is Yue Lin (/ˈjuːeɪ lɪn/, or 林越 in Chinese), and welcome to my personal website. 
Currently, I am a research assistant in School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, fortunately advised by Prof. Baoxiang Wang.
Here, I will regularly update my experiences, notes, and computational magic spells of all the techniques that interest me.

> To redeem those who lived in the past and to recreate all "it was" into "thus I willed it" — that alone should I call redemption.
