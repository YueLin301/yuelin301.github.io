## Innovative design and simulation of a transformable robot with flexibility and versatility, RHex-T3
RHex-T3 = RHex - **T**o **T**he **T**op (for it can climb ladders)
> RHex is a highly successful robot with excellent properties. The robot has six legs that are shaped like semicircles, with a motor installed at the end of each arc. We have redesigned its legs to perform a wide range of functions.

Unfortunately, a **substantial** amount of code I wrote (kinematics, simulation, physical control) cannot be made public, because the lab I used to work will continue to conduct related research.
