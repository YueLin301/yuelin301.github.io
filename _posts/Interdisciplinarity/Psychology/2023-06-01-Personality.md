## Foreword

One may choose to disregard their own labels (and bear the consequences, good or bad, of doing so), believing that the labeling system is flawed. However, they cannot claim to be without labels or cannot be defined.

This post aims to briefly introduce three personality models: The Big Five, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and Enneagram. The Big Five is generally well-regarded and supported by research in the psychology community, whereas the MBTI and Enneagram are viewed more critically, with concerns about their scientific validity and reliability.

But I believe that these tools are all efficient communication protocols, and using them allows me to easily introduce my profile.
Because if these models are common knowledge between me and my readers, then my test results will encapsulate a wealth of information about my behavioral habits and thought preferences.

After understanding these models, analyzing the characters in film and literary works will also yield many interesting new perspectives.

## Big Five Personality Test

The Big Five personality traits system is a widely accepted framework in psychology, consisting of five broad dimensions that describe human personality: 
- Openness (inventiveness and curiosity vs. consistency and caution), 
- Conscientiousness (efficiency and organization vs. easy-going and careless), 
- Extraversion (outgoing and energetic vs. solitary and reserved), 
- Agreeableness (friendly and compassionate vs. challenging and detached), and 
- Neuroticism (sensitive and nervous vs. secure and confident).

This model is empirically driven and is considered robust for understanding personality due to its extensive research base, cross-cultural validity, and ability to predict various life outcomes. It's praised for capturing the complexity of human personality traits in a comprehensive yet flexible manner.

{: .prompt-warning}

### **Extraversion**
Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world.

#### Friendliness
Friendly people genuinely like other people and openly demonstrate positive feelings toward others. They make friends quickly and it is easy for them to form close, intimate relationships. Low scorers on Friendliness are not necessarily cold and hostile, but they do not reach out to others and are perceived as distant and reserved.

#### Gregariousness
Gregarious people find the company of others pleasantly stimulating and rewarding. They enjoy the excitement of crowds. Low scorers tend to feel overwhelmed by, and therefore actively avoid, large crowds. They do not necessarily dislike being with people sometimes, but their need for privacy and time to themselves is much greater than for individuals who score high on this scale.

#### Assertiveness
High scorers Assertiveness like to speak out, take charge, and direct the activities of others. They tend to be leaders in groups. Low scorers tend not to talk much and let others control the activities of groups.

#### Activity Level
Active individuals lead fast-paced, busy lives. They move about quickly, energetically, and vigorously, and they are involved in many activities. People who score low on this scale follow a slower and more leisurely, relaxed pace.

#### Excitement-Seeking
High scorers on this scale are easily bored without high levels of stimulation. They love bright lights and hustle and bustle. They are likely to take risks and seek thrills. Low scorers are overwhelmed by noise and commotion and are adverse to thrill-seeking.

#### Cheerfulness
This scale measures positive mood and feelings, not negative emotions (which are a part of the Neuroticism domain). Persons who score high on this scale typically experience a range of positive feelings, including happiness, enthusiasm, optimism, and joy. Low scorers are not as prone to such energetic, high spirits.

### **Neuroticism**
Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings.

#### Anxiety
The "fight-or-flight" system of the brain of anxious individuals is too easily and too often engaged. Therefore, people who are high in anxiety often feel like something dangerous is about to happen. They may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful. They feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally calm and fearless.

#### Anger
Persons who score high in Anger feel enraged when things do not go their way. They are sensitive about being treated fairly and feel resentful and bitter when they feel they are being cheated. This scale measures the tendency to feel angry; whether or not the person expresses annoyance and hostility depends on the individual's level on Agreeableness. Low scorers do not get angry often or easily.

#### Depression
This scale measures the tendency to feel sad, dejected, and discouraged. High scorers lack energy and have difficulty initiating activities. Low scorers tend to be free from these depressive feelings.

#### Self-Consciousness
Self-conscious individuals are sensitive about what others think of them. Their concern about rejection and ridicule cause them to feel shy and uncomfortable around others. They are easily embarrassed and often feel ashamed. Their fears that others will criticize or make fun of them are exaggerated and unrealistic, but their awkwardness and discomfort may make these fears a self-fulfilling prophecy. Low scorers, in contrast, do not suffer from the mistaken impression that everyone is watching and judging them. They do not feel nervous in social situations.

#### Immoderation
Immoderate individuals feel strong cravings and urges that they have have difficulty resisting. They tend to be oriented toward short-term pleasures and rewards rather than long- term consequences. Low scorers do not experience strong, irresistible cravings and consequently do not find themselves tempted to overindulge.

#### Vulnerability
High scorers on Vulnerability experience panic, confusion, and helplessness when under pressure or stress. Low scorers feel more poised, confident, and clear-thinking when stressed.


### **Conscientiousness**
Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.

#### Self-Efficacy
Self-Efficacy describes confidence in one's ability to accomplish things. High scorers believe they have the intelligence (common sense), drive, and self-control necessary for achieving success. Low scorers do not feel effective, and may have a sense that they are not in control of their lives.

#### Orderliness
Persons with high scores on orderliness are well-organized. They like to live according to routines and schedules. They keep lists and make plans. Low scorers tend to be disorganized and scattered.

#### Dutifulness
This scale reflects the strength of a person's sense of duty and obligation. Those who score high on this scale have a strong sense of moral obligation. Low scorers find contracts, rules, and regulations overly confining. They are likely to be seen as unreliable or even irresponsible.

#### Achievement-Striving
Individuals who score high on this scale strive hard to achieve excellence. Their drive to be recognized as successful keeps them on track toward their lofty goals. They often have a strong sense of direction in life, but extremely high scores may be too single-minded and obsessed with their work. Low scorers are content to get by with a minimal amount of work, and might be seen by others as lazy.

#### Self-Discipline
Self-discipline-what many people call will-power-refers to the ability to persist at difficult or unpleasant tasks until they are completed. People who possess high self-discipline are able to overcome reluctance to begin tasks and stay on track despite distractions. Those with low self-discipline procrastinate and show poor follow-through, often failing to complete tasks-even tasks they want very much to complete.

#### Cautiousness
Cautiousness describes the disposition to think through possibilities before acting. High scorers on the Cautiousness scale take their time when making decisions. Low scorers often say or do first thing that comes to mind without deliberating alternatives and the probable consequences of those alternatives.


### **Agreeableness**
Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.

#### Trust
A person with high trust assumes that most people are fair, honest, and have good intentions. Persons low in trust see others as selfish, devious, and potentially dangerous.

#### Morality
High scorers on this scale see no need for pretense or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore candid, frank, and sincere. Low scorers believe that a certain amount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward high-scorers on this scale. They generally find it more difficult to relate to the unstraightforward low-scorers on this scale. It should be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly reveal the whole truth.

#### Altruism
Altruistic people find helping other people genuinely rewarding. Consequently, they are generally willing to assist those who are in need. Altruistic people find that doing things for others is a form of self-fulfillment rather than self-sacrifice. Low scorers on this scale do not particularly like helping those in need. Requests for help feel like an imposition rather than an opportunity for self-fulfillment.

#### Cooperation
Individuals who score high on this scale dislike confrontations. They are perfectly willing to compromise or to deny their own needs in order to get along with others. Those who score low on this scale are more likely to intimidate others to get their way.

#### Modesty
High scorers on this scale do not like to claim that they are better than other people. In some cases this attitude may derive from low self-confidence or self-esteem. Nonetheless, some people with high self-esteem find immodesty unseemly. Those who are willing to describe themselves as superior tend to be seen as disagreeably arrogant by other people.

#### Sympathy
People who score high on this scale are tenderhearted and compassionate. They feel the pain of others vicariously and are easily moved to pity. Low scorers are not affected strongly by human suffering. They pride themselves on making objective judgments based on reason. They are more concerned with truth and impartial justice than with mercy.


### **Openness To Experience**
Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people.

#### Imagination
To imaginative individuals, the real world is often too plain and ordinary. High scorers on this scale use fantasy as a way of creating a richer, more interesting world. Low scorers are on this scale are more oriented to facts than fantasy.

#### Artistic Interests
High scorers on this scale love beauty, both in art and in nature. They become easily involved and absorbed in artistic and natural events. They are not necessarily artistically trained nor talented, although many will be. The defining features of this scale are interest in, and appreciation of natural and artificial beauty. Low scorers lack aesthetic sensitivity and interest in the arts.

#### Emotionality
Persons high on Emotionality have good access to and awareness of their own feelings. Low scorers are less aware of their feelings and tend not to express their emotions openly.

#### Adventurousness
High scorers on adventurousness are eager to try new activities, travel to foreign lands, and experience different things. They find familiarity and routine boring, and will take a new route home just because it is different. Low scorers tend to feel uncomfortable with change and prefer familiar routines.

#### Intellect
Intellect and artistic interests are the two most important, central aspects of openness to experience. High scorers on Intellect love to play with ideas. They are open-minded to new and unusual ideas, and like to debate intellectual issues. They enjoy riddles, puzzles, and brain teasers. Low scorers on Intellect prefer dealing with either people or things rather than ideas. They regard intellectual exercises as a waste of time. Intellect should not be equated with intelligence. Intellect is an intellectual style, not an intellectual ability, although high scorers on Intellect score slightly higher than low-Intellect individuals on standardized intelligence tests.

#### Liberalism
Psychological liberalism refers to a readiness to challenge authority, convention, and traditional values. In its most extreme form, psychological liberalism can even represent outright hostility toward rules, sympathy for law-breakers, and love of ambiguity, chaos, and disorder. Psychological conservatives prefer the security and stability brought by conformity to tradition. Psychological liberalism and conservatism are not identical to political affiliation, but certainly incline individuals toward certain political parties.


## MBTI and Cognitive Functions

### Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

> This section is adapted from the answer generated by ChatGPT-4.
{: .prompt-info }

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is another popular personality framework, particularly in non-academic settings like business and career counseling. It categorizes people into 16 distinct personality types based on four dichotomies: 
- [**Introversion vs. Extraversion.**](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted) This dimension describes how individuals draw and expend their energy. Extraverts (E) are energized by interaction with others and the external world. They tend to be sociable, outgoing, and more comfortable in groups or social situations. Introverts (I), in contrast, are energized by spending time alone or in quiet environments. They are often reflective, reserved, and more comfortable working independently or in smaller groups. This preference doesn't necessarily determine social skills or shyness; it's more about where one gets their energy from.
- [**Sensing vs. Intuition.**](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant) This dimension indicates how individuals prefer to gather information. People who prefer Sensing (S) focus on the present and concrete information gained from their senses. They are detail-oriented, practical, and prefer to deal with facts and real-world applications. Intuitive types (N), however, are more focused on possibilities and what might be. They enjoy thinking about the future, abstract concepts, and the big picture. They value imagination and innovation more than practical applications.
- [**Thinking vs. Feeling.**](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling) This dimension describes how people prefer to make decisions. Thinkers (T) make decisions based on logic and objective analysis. They value principles, consistency, and impersonal truth, often focusing on the task rather than people. Feelers (F), on the other hand, are more concerned with harmony and the well-being of others. Their decisions are influenced more by personal values and the impact on people. They are empathetic, compassionate, and tend to prioritize relationships in their decision-making process.
- [**Judging vs. Perceiving.**](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting) This dimension relates to how individuals prefer to organize their lives. Judging types (J) like structure, firm decisions, and clear rules. They prefer planning and organizing their lives and tend to be decisive, efficient, and task-focused. Perceiving types (P), conversely, prefer to remain open to new information and options. They are more spontaneous, flexible, and adaptable. Perceivers are less structured and more comfortable adapting to changes and exploring various possibilities.

Furthermore, there is a fifth letter in some MBTI representations, such as "INTJ-T," originates from the 16Personalities framework and represents an additional dimension known as "Identity," which is not part of the original MBTI model. 
- [**Assertive vs. Turbulent.**](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent) This dimension is divided into "Assertive" (A) and "Turbulent" (T) traits. Assertive individuals are typically confident, relaxed, and resistant to stress, maintaining a stable level of emotional resilience. In contrast, Turbulent individuals are more likely to be self-conscious, sensitive to stress, and driven by a desire for improvement, often experiencing wider emotional fluctuations and a strong sense of ambition. This Assertive/Turbulent aspect, blending elements from the Big Five personality traits, adds another layer to personality assessment, offering a nuanced view of one's overall disposition and reaction to stress and change.

Developed from Carl Jung's theory of psychological types, MBTI is often used for personal development, career planning, and team building. However, it has faced criticism from the academic psychology community due to concerns about its scientific validity, reliability, and lack of empirical support, as people may receive different type designations upon retaking the test.

### Jungian cognitive functions

The MBTI is heavily influenced by the theories of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, particularly his concept of cognitive functions.

Jung proposed a theory of psychological types in his 1921 work "Psychological Types."
He introduced the concepts of introversion and extraversion as the main orientations of personality and added four psychological functions through which people experience the world: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition.
These functions could operate in either an extraverted or introverted mode, leading to a total of eight distinct functions in his theory.

> Cognitive functions, also referred to as psychological functions, as described by Carl Jung in his book Psychological Types, are particular mental processes within a person's psyche that are present regardless of common circumstance. This is a concept that serves as one of the foundations for his theory on personality type. In his book, he noted four main psychological functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition. He introduced them with having either an internally focused (introverted) or externally focused (extraverted) tendency which he called "attitudes". He also categorizes the functions as either rational (thinking and feeling) or irrational (intuition and sensation).
> — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions).

The MBTI was developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers in the 1940s. They were influenced by Jung’s theory and sought to apply it in a more practical, accessible way.
While they retained Jung's basic concepts of extraversion/introversion and the four functions (thinking, feeling, sensing, and intuition), they added a new dimension: Judging vs. Perceiving. This was not explicitly part of Jung's original theory but was inferred from his descriptions of how people use their judging (thinking and feeling) and perceiving (sensing and intuition) functions.

In MBTI, the combination of Extraversion vs. Introversion with the four functions results in eight possible cognitive functions (e.g., extraverted thinking, introverted feeling, etc.).
These functions are used to determine the 16 MBTI types, with each type having a primary function that dominates their personality. The MBTI also considers secondary and tertiary functions in its personality descriptions, attempting to create a more holistic view of each personality type.
In summary, the MBTI is an adaptation and extension of Carl Jung's theory of cognitive functions. It maintains the core of Jung's ideas but simplifies and expands them to create a more structured and easily applicable personality typology. However, it's important to note that the MBTI's interpretation and application of Jung's theories are not without criticism, particularly from academic psychologists who question the MBTI's scientific validity and reliability.

![](../../../assets/img/2023-06-01-Personality/img_2023-12-26-08-58-02.png)


#### Ni: Introverted Intuition
**Introverted Intuition (Ni)** is an information-gathering function that focuses on internal insights and foresight. Unlike Extraverted Intuition, which explores a breadth of possibilities and ideas in the external world, Ni delves deeply into a few concepts, often looking for underlying meanings and future implications. Individuals who primarily use Ni are typically future-oriented, valuing insights and intuitions that come from a deep understanding of the past and present. They are drawn to theories and abstract ideas, and are skilled at recognizing patterns and predicting outcomes. Ni users often have a strong vision or sense of where things are heading, leading them to be strategic in their approach. This introspective function can sometimes make them seem detached from current realities, as they are more focused on their internal world of ideas and possibilities.

#### Te: Extraverted Thinking
**Extraverted Thinking (Te)** is a decision-making function that emphasizes organization, efficiency, and logic in the external world. In contrast to Introverted Thinking, which is concerned with internal logical consistency, Te is focused on applying logic and reasoning to achieve tangible results and objectives. Individuals with a dominant Te function are often practical, systematic, and goal-oriented, excelling in planning and execution. They value clear structures and are adept at organizing people and resources effectively to accomplish tasks. Te users are typically decisive and direct, preferring objective criteria and measurable outcomes in decision-making. However, this focus on external efficiency can sometimes lead to overlooking personal values or the emotional aspects of situations.


#### Fi: Introverted Feeling
**Introverted Feeling (Fi)** is a decision-making function that centers on personal values, emotions, and authenticity. Contrasting with Extraverted Feeling, which is attuned to external emotions and social dynamics, Fi focuses on understanding and aligning with one's own emotional experiences and moral compass. Individuals who primarily use Fi are often introspective and value authenticity highly. They are deeply in touch with their own feelings and values and make decisions based on what feels right and true to them. Fi users are typically empathetic and compassionate, with a strong sense of individuality. They strive for inner harmony and integrity, but this inward focus can sometimes lead them to feel misunderstood or out of step with the broader social context.

#### Se: Extraverted Sensing
**Extraverted Sensing (Se)** is an information-gathering function that focuses on the immediate sensory experience in the external world. Unlike Introverted Sensing, which relies on past experiences and internal sensations, Se is about being attuned to the present moment and the physical environment. Individuals with a dominant Se function are typically very aware of their surroundings and enjoy engaging with the physical world. They are often action-oriented, spontaneous, and adaptable, thriving in situations that require quick responses and presence. Se users are drawn to tangible experiences and enjoy sensory pleasures. They tend to be practical and realistic, preferring concrete facts over abstract theories. However, this focus on the immediate can sometimes lead to a lack of long-term planning or consideration of future implications.

#### Ne: Extraverted Intuition
**Extraverted Intuition (Ne)** is an information-gathering function that focuses on exploring the external world of possibilities and ideas. Unlike its introverted counterpart, Ne operates by actively seeking out and connecting a wide array of external stimuli, concepts, and ideas. Individuals with a dominant Ne are often seen as innovative and creative, constantly scanning the environment for new opportunities and patterns. They are adept at seeing multiple perspectives and are often excited by the potential and what could be, rather than what is. Ne users have a tendency to jump from one idea to another, driven by their curiosity and a desire to understand the broader context of things. This function enables them to be flexible and adaptable, but it can also lead to a lack of focus on current realities.


#### Ti: Introverted Thinking
**Introverted Thinking (Ti)** is a decision-making function that focuses on internal logic and precision. Ti analyzes information in a detached and objective manner, aiming for a clear understanding of principles and underlying structures. Unlike Extraverted Thinking, which is concerned with external organization and efficiency, Ti seeks to develop an internal framework that makes logical sense. Individuals who primarily use Ti are often analytical and critical thinkers, valuing accuracy and coherence in their thought processes. They are driven to understand how things work and are skilled at identifying inconsistencies. Ti users can appear reserved and thoughtful, as they prefer to take their time to process information internally before reaching conclusions. This function, however, can sometimes lead to overthinking or getting lost in complex, abstract concepts.

#### Fe: Extraverted Feeling
**Extraverted Feeling (Fe)** is a decision-making function that is attuned to the emotions and needs of others. It is oriented towards creating harmony and building relationships in the external world. Unlike Introverted Feeling, which is focused on personal values and inner emotional experiences, Fe is concerned with maintaining social dynamics and understanding the emotional states of others. People who use Fe as a dominant function are often empathetic, cooperative, and sensitive to the feelings of those around them. They are adept at reading social cues and adjusting their behavior to suit the group's needs or to avoid conflict. Fe users value community and seek to establish a sense of belonging, often placing a high priority on group consensus and shared values. However, this focus on external harmony can sometimes lead to neglecting their own emotional needs or conforming too much to social expectations.


#### Si: Introverted Sensing
**Introverted Sensing (Si)** is an information-gathering function that focuses on internal sensations, experiences, and memories. It contrasts with Extraverted Sensing, which is more about immediate sensory perception. Si involves storing and recalling past experiences to understand and navigate the present. Individuals with a dominant Si function tend to be detail-oriented, reliable, and have a strong connection to their past experiences and learned knowledge. They value tradition and consistency, often preferring familiar routines and methods. Si users are skilled at noticing changes in their environment, as they have a deep understanding of how things usually are or should be. This function contributes to a strong sense of practicality and realism. However, an overreliance on past experiences can sometimes limit their openness to new possibilities and change.

## Enneagram

The Enneagram is a personality system that describes nine primary personality types, each with its own set of characteristics, motivations, fears, and desires. Its origins are more spiritual and mystical, tracing back to ancient traditions. The Enneagram has become popular in various self-help and spiritual contexts and is sometimes used in counseling for personal and relational growth. Despite its popularity in these areas, the Enneagram is viewed with skepticism by the mainstream psychology community due to its lack of empirical evidence and scientific grounding. Critics point out that its categories are too vague and subjective, making it difficult to validate and study scientifically.

[This website](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions) provides a great introduction to the nine types of the Enneagram.

### Tritype
The tritype theory suggests that while individuals have a primary Enneagram type, they also exhibit significant characteristics of two other types.
These three types – one from each of the Enneagram's centers of intelligence (Heart/Feeling, Head/Thinking, Gut/Instinct) – combine to form a person's tritype. For example, someone could have a tritype of 4-7-1, meaning their primary type is in the Heart center (type 4), but they also strongly identify with a type in the Head center (type 7) and the Gut center (type 1).

<!-- My tritye is [548](https://wiki.personality-database.com/books/enneagram/page/458-the-scholar-archetype). -->

### Instincts

{: .prompt-info }

The Enneagram, a model of the human psyche, includes a concept known as the three instincts. These instincts are thought to be key drivers in human behavior and are combined in different ways to form six distinct instinctual variants. Here's an overview of each instinct and the combinations:

1. **Self-Preservation (SP)**: This instinct focuses on survival and well-being. Individuals with a dominant self-preservation instinct are often concerned with their safety, comfort, health, and financial security. They are inclined to prioritize personal needs and may excel in managing practical aspects of life.

2. **Sexual (SX)**: Also known as the "one-to-one" instinct, this is centered around intensity, passion, and personal connections. Individuals with a dominant sexual instinct seek deep and intense interpersonal experiences. They are often very passionate and focused on creating strong bonds with others, sometimes at the expense of wider social relationships.

3. **Social (SO)**: This instinct is about belonging, status, and interpersonal relationships within groups. Individuals with a dominant social instinct are attuned to their position and role in social contexts and are often skilled at navigating social dynamics. They prioritize group needs and community involvement.

The six combinations of these instincts are:

1. **SP/SX (Self-Preservation/Sexual)**: Individuals with this variant balance concerns for personal needs and safety with a desire for intense interpersonal relationships. They may prioritize their wellbeing but also seek depth and passion in their close relationships.

2. **SP/SO (Self-Preservation/Social)**: Here, the focus on self-preservation is coupled with an awareness of social dynamics. These individuals are often practical and security-oriented, but also value their roles and status within their communities.

3. **SX/SP (Sexual/Self-Preservation)**: This variant combines the desire for intense personal connections with a concern for self-preservation. Individuals with this combination are passionate and seek deep bonds, while also being mindful of their personal safety and comfort.

4. **SX/SO (Sexual/Social)**: Individuals with this combination seek intense relationships and are also attuned to their social environment. They are passionate about their connections and often play significant roles in their social circles.

5. **SO/SP (Social/Self-Preservation)**: This variant emphasizes social belonging and group dynamics, along with a concern for personal safety and needs. These individuals are community-oriented but also mindful of their personal security and wellbeing.

6. **SO/SX (Social/Sexual)**: Here, the social instinct blends with the desire for intense personal connections. Individuals with this combination are often deeply involved in their social groups and seek meaningful, passionate relationships within these communities.



## My Doubts

In my understanding, each type combination from these two systems indicates a cognitive pattern. But
1. Can a person's cognitive pattern be scenario-dependent? Is it possible for a person to be equipped with two or more cognitive patterns and to be able to use them depending on the current situation or moods? If so, we may need a meta-system to sort out the meta-policies for people coping with different scenarios. For example, a common defense for MBTI is the metaphor about handedness: When catching a ball flying toward their face, some people tend to use their left hand while others tend to use their right hand. But, I've seen some people who use their left hand when eating and their right hand when writing.
2. Is there a more general way to describe cognitive functions? Such as using the time series model, maybe?
3. I know that we should type a person by analyzing the way they think. But is it possible that there are two or more perspectives that fit the ground true thinking pattern? If so, it means that the mapping from people's cognitive patterns to the types is a mess and typing a person is intractable. And from my experience, I think that some questions in the tests are not appropriate, for there can be deep complex different reasons for tending to do the same thing.
