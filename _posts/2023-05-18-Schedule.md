## Writing Schedule

Generally, I will finish my blogs in the following order: 
1. [Details on the Analysis of Policy Gradient Methods](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Policy-Gradient-Details/);
2. [MARL Basics](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/MARL-Basics/);
3. [Fictitious Play Basics](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Fictitious-Play-Basics/);
4. [Fictitious Play in MARL](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Fictitious-Play-MARL/);
5. [Information Design (A Note)](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Information-Design/): Almost finished;

Depending on the circumstances, there may be additional blogs added to the queue along the way. 
The order of completion is not fixed.
If I come up with something and have spare time, I will add content to the corresponding blog at any time.
