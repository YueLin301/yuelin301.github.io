## Writing Schedule

Generally, I will finish my blogs in the following order: 
1. [Details on the Analysis of Policy Gradient Methods](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Policy-Gradient-Details/);
2. [MARL Basics](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/MARL-Basics/);
3. [Fictitious Play](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Fictitious-Play/);
4. [Information Design](https://yuelin301.github.io/posts/Information-Design/): Almost finished;

Depending on the circumstances, there may be additional blogs added to the queue along the way. 
The order of completion is not fixed.
If I come up with something and have spare time, I will add content to the corresponding blog at any time.
