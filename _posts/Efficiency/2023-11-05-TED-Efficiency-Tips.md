## Communication Skills

### [How to speak so that people want to listen | Julian Treasure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI)

#### Avoid these habits

- Gossip
- Judging
- Negativity
- Complaining
- Excuses
- Exaggeration (Lying)
- Dogmatism


#### Principles

- Honesty: Be clear and straight.
- Authenticity: Be yourself.
- Integrity: Be your word.
- Love: Wish them well.

#### The way you say it
- Humans prefer voices that are low (coming from chest, rather than from the nose or the throat). Because we associate depth with power and with authority.
- We prefer voices rich, warm, smooth.  You can train to get there (coach, posture, breathing, exercises).
- Change tones, to communicate meanings. Dont use wrong tonality and make it reflect what you are trying to communicate.
- Pace
  - Silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence. We don't have to fill it with "um"s and "ah"s.
- Pitch: How high.
- Volume: Loud or quiet.

#### Vocal warm-up exercises
- Arms up, deep breath in while saying"Ahhhh": Breath out as arms go down
- Warm up lips "bah, bah, bah..."
- Lips coming alive "brrrr" like kids
- Tongue exaggerated "la, la, la, la"
- "Rrrrrrrrr" like champagne for the tongue
- Siren high to low "oooweeeeaaaw"

### [7 Ways to Make a Conversation With Anyone | Malavika Varadan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Zu5ZZAG7I)

1. The first word flood gates. Just say it. "Hi" with a big smile.
2. Skip the small talk. Ask really personal questions. Just ask something unique and personal.
   1. "An interesting name. How did you parents think of it? Is there a story behind it?"
   2. "How long have you lived in this city? Do you remember the first day you landed here?"
   3. "Where do you come from? Where do you family live?"
3. Find the "Mee-Too"s.
4. Pay a unique compliment. The people will forget what you do, and they forget what you say, but they never forget how you make them feel.
