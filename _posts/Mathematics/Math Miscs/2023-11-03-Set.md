## Supremum & Infimum

The **supremum** of a nonempty set $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ is the smallest scalar $y$ such that

$$
y \geq x \text { for all } x \in X.
$$

The **infimum** of a set $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ is the largest scalar $y$ such that

$$
y \leq x \text { for all } x \in X.
$$

If $\sup X \in X(\inf X \in X)$, then $\sup X=\max X(\inf X=\min X)$. 

Example:

- $\sup \set{1 / n: n \geq 1}=\max \set{1 / n: n \geq 1}=1,$
- $\inf \set{1 / n: n \geq 1}=0 .$


1. Closed set
2. Bounded set
3. Compact set
4. Complete

For $\epsilon>0$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ we define $B_\epsilon(x)=\set{y \in \mathbb{R}^n:\|x-y\|<\epsilon}$ to be open ball with radius $\epsilon$ and center $x.$ Next, we collect further properties and terminologies for sets:
- A set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is called open if for every $x \in X$ there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $B_\epsilon(x) \subset X.$
- A set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed if $\mathbb{R}^n \backslash X$ is open. Alternatively, we can define closedness of set as follows: For every sequence $\left(x^k\right)$ with $x^k \in X$ for all $k$ and $x^k \rightarrow x$, we have $x \in X.$
- A set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is bounded if there exists $B \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\|x\| \leq B$ for all $x \in X$.
- A bounded and closed set is called compact.


<!-- Consider subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$: -->
- The set $\{(洧논,洧녽)\mid 洧논^2+洧녽^2<1\}$ is bounded but not closed. 
- The set $\{(洧논,洧녽)\mid 洧논\ge0\}$ is closed but not bounded.
