> Despite some individuals misusing the personality type scale on forums, it remains a useful tool as it **clusters** people's behavioral tendencies based on multiple dimensions. Therefore, sharing my personality type with someone familiar with this system is an efficient way to describe my profile. I hope that you won't hold any biases against me for utilizing this system. :)
