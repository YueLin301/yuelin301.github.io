> In English, the term "oracle" has several related but distinct meanings:
> 
> 1. **Ancient Prophet**: The most traditional meaning originates from ancient Greek culture, referring to an oracle or prophet, often associated with religious or mystical rituals, capable of providing predictions about the future or wisdom to solve difficult problems. Such oracles are usually linked to a specific sacred site or temple, such as the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.
> 
> 2. **Authoritative Source**: More broadly, "oracle" can refer to any source considered authoritative in knowledge or truth. This could be a person, a book, or anything regarded as having definitive answers or profound knowledge.
> 
> 3. **Usage in Computer Science**: In computer science and related fields, "oracle" typically refers to a theoretical mechanism or device that can solve specific problems or perform certain computational tasks, especially those that current algorithms or technologies cannot handle. This usage is derived from its original meaning regarding divine prophecy, emphasizing its capability to provide decisive solutions.
> 
> For example, in algorithm theory, an oracle might refer to a black box device capable of solving specific types of problems (such as calculating optimal responses in PSRO), while in software or technological products, an oracle might refer to a component or service that provides exact answers or data.
