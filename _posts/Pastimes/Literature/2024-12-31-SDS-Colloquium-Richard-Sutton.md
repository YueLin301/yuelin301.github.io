最后提问的问题是现在大模型这么popular，我们做RL的researcher现在应该做什么，现在什么方向是比较好的，然后上面是Sutton的回答

> So maybe, you see what else are doing, and deliberately try to do something different, Or, maybe you are thinking, everyone is doing this, I have to do it! They are both points of view. I reject both of them. You should ignore what is popular or not popular. **You should do what makes sense to you.** You should be neutral to popularity. It is sort of a hard thing to do, but I think it is the right anwser.

slides本身是提供了一些视角，讲的是Sensorimotor Experience

此外就是一些take home的观点，认为LLM不能到AGI，因为它没有目标。现在RL在LLM里的应用还是很degenerated的情况。
