## The Reason for its Name
SSCC = **S**winging **S**earch (self-motion for path planning) and **C**rawling **C**ontrol (crawling into the pipe like a snake)
> Self-motion is a special kind of motion for redundant manipulators. Given a fixed base and an end target, there can be more than one possible solution configuration due to its redundancy. Searching configurations (for a collision-free path) within these constraints (fixing both ends of a manipulator) can be likened to **a rope swinging in the air**.
